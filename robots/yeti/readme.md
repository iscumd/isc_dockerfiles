Rolling builds a local Yeti workspace on each run, allowing for active development without needing to rebuild the container on each change. Plain Yeti is the production image that bakes the yeti code into the image, preventing unwanted changes from occurring in production and launching without needing to rebuild the code.

See the upper level readme for more details.
