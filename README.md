# isc_dockerfiles

Contains Dockerfiles used in ISC projects.


Dockerfiles should each be in a topical folder (ex. 'robots') and then put inside another folder (ex. Ohm) alongside any other files that should be in the Docker context. This is done to prevent Dockerfiles from consuming other folders and building a large context.
